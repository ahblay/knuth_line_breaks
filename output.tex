 \fontdimen2\font=0.8076923076923077em I hope it is not too precious to include an explanation of the algorithm 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.7916666666666667em as example text for the algorithm. The main function that does the heavy 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.6875em lifting is calculate-breakpoints(). This function runs in O(n-squared) time, 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.7916666666666667em iterating once over the words in our sample text, and then comparing each 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.75em word to a subset of potential line breaks. A more detailed explanation of 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.8636363636363636em this algorithm follows. We begin by setting the first breakpoint at the 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.7692307692307692em beginning of the text. We then iterate through the words of the text, at 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.6818181818181819em each step assessing the line starting at the first breakpoint, and extending 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.7857142857142857em up through the word we are on. Each of these lines is assigned a score, 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.7272727272727273em determined by the stretching or shrinking factor necessary to fit this line 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.5384615384615384em to the prescribed length (as set in `target'). If the spaces must be stretched 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.7727272727272727em or shrunk beyond their capacity (or tolerance), the line is disregarded as 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.9166666666666667em unfeasible. However, if a line is feasible, its score is saved, and a 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.7272727272727273em new line in considered, now extending from the second breakpoint (should it 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.6818181818181819em exist) to our current word. Once all possible breakpoints are assessed, the 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.8636363636363636em one with the lowest cost is appended to the list `candidate-breaks'. We 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.5555555555555556em continue in this fashion, updating `candidate-breaks' with growing sequences of 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.6666666666666666em possible breakpoints until we reach the end of the text. When the algorithm 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.95em reaches the final word, it again calculates the optimal breakpoints for 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.7222222222222222em that word. It then considers all remaining sequences in `candidate-breaks'. 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.9090909090909092em Each of these is assigned a cumulative score corresponding to the total 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.36363636363636365em stretching/shrinking factor of all of its constituent lines. The sequence with the 

 \fontdimen2\font=0.6818181818181819em lowest score is chosen, and its corresponding breakpoints are applied to the 

 \fontdimen2\font=0em text.
